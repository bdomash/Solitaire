# Solitaire
This repo includes all of the files for the Solitaire game, which I originally coded for my final project of CS Data Structures in High School, but have since updated to add different features of gameplay.

The game includes a GUI (graphical user interface), which is primarily implemented in the Frame class.

The bulk of the game is coded in the Solitaire class, which instantiates nearly each of the other classes, and works together with the Frame class to display the game's graphics.

The images for the cards, card backs, and some of the menus icons are also included here, as well as a screenshot of what the gameplay looks like. Finally, a few text files for the game are included, which keeps track of the settings, user's moves during gameplay, and a gamelog of each game played used to calculate user statistics.

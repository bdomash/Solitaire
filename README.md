# Solitaire
This resitory includes all of the files for the Solitaire game, which I coded for my final project as a senior in High School.
The game includes a GUI (graphical user interface), which is primarily coded in the Frame class.
The bulk of the game is coded in the Solitaire class, which I will admit is not organized the best.
The images for the cards, card backs, and some of the menus are also included here, as well as a screenshot of what the gameplay looks like.
